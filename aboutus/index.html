                Health card is a website which provides complete health history of a person based on their unique
                identification number. At the time of emergency, this will provide assistance to the doctors to assist
                the patient who comes without a guardian. The main objective is to make the health care system more efficient, less time
                consuming during emergencies. A unique identification number will be used as a primary key which will
                help in maintaining the authenticity of the medical records. The users can update their health profiles
                on a monthly basis and can also upload their medical reports on our portal. The emergency medical
                personnel can then enter the unique identification number to automatically retrieve medical information
                and medical history of the patient. This information can then be used appropriately for immediate and correct diagnosis and treatment.
